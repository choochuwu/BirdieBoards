Inspired by the Absolem, Kyria, A.Dux Balbuzard and many other brilliant keyboards that I have seen over the years.

This is a 36 key, MX only, hotswap only “Unsplit” or unibody keyboard designed to be used with ProMicro compatible dev boards. The halves are each rotated 40° which is somewhat intense compared to most other available unibody designs.

If you use a Nice!Nano and spring pin headers the mcu portion of assembly does not require solder. 

I have designed this board to be used with a sandwich style case. The required files to have this case fabricated are included in this repository.

This board was designed using Ergogen which can be found [here](https://ergogen.xyz)

This keyboard wouldn’t be possible without the Absolem Club Discord server and it’s members. You can find it [here](https://discord.gg/EEDZyyrxMy)
